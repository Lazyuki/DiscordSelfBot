# DiscordSelfBot
Selfbot for Discord Using 2 accounts
Written in Python using discord.py.

## Why use 2 accounts?
When you join many servers (70~), setting up a connection
takes a while, and your bot receives all the messages from
servers that you never go to. e.g. emote servers.
This uses another account that joins only the servers you care.
Thus it's lightweight and takes up less bandwidth.

## Set up
Configure in config.json
